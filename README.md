# cloud-pareidolias

Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists. Like seeing a face in this picture:

This project focuses on finding pareidolias in clouds, and the process to do that is the following:
## Take a picture of the sky

## Process picture:
#### Find Region Of Interest (ROI)
#### Classify image
#### Correct outlines according to class found
#### Generate pix2pix
#### Create final image
   
## Tweet picture
    
3. Classify the cloud and find out what the algorithm thinks it looks like
4. Generate a drawing of how the algorithm imagines this thing would look in the cloud. 
5. Tweet image so you can get a notification when there's an interesting cloud to look at in the sky!
